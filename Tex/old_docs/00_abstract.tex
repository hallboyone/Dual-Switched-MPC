This work explores systems with an additive disturbance where an imperfect preview is provided. Two external switching signals alter the structure and constraints of the system -- one switches the system's dynamics, constraints, and/or cost function, the other switches an size of error allowed in the preview. This system is motivated by applications to distributed systems with external switching. The feasibility of such a system cannot be ensured using current research and naive expansions require set operations in high dimensions. This work presents a techniques to reformat the problem as a linear disturbed problem and reduce the dimension of the required set operations. The resulting controller is persistently feasible under all possible combinations of both switching signals.
