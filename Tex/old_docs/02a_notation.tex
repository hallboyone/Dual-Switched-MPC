\begin{itemize}
    \item Blackboard font is used to denote a vector space
    \item Calligraphy font is used to denote subsets. In this work, these usually denote polyhedron
    \item Given an ordered vector space, $\mathbb{S}$ and elements $a,b\in\mathbb{S}$, the subset $\mathbb{S}_{[a,b]}$ is the set from $a$ to $b$ inclusive To denote exclusion of the bounds, parenthesis are used instead of brackets. $\mathbb{S}_{\geq a}$ is the set of all elements of $\mathbb{S}$ that satisfy the inequality.
    \item The Fraktur font is used to denote a sequence of vectors. For example, $\mathfrak{u}=\{u_0,...,u_{N-1}\}$ is a sequence of inputs.
