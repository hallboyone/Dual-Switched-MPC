abstract = {A method to ensure recursive feasibility and asymptotic stability for a distributed model predictive control scheme in case of temporary communication failure is presented. The considered networks are made up of dynamically uncoupled nonlinear systems, coupled through constraints and objectives. The proposed method substitutes affected coupling constraints in such a way that the scheme can not become infeasible, while a decrease in the cost is guaranteed.},
