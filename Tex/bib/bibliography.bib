@article{Schaich2014,
abstract = {A method to ensure recursive feasibility and asymptotic stability for a distributed model predictive control scheme in case of temporary communication failure is presented. The considered networks are made up of dynamically uncoupled nonlinear systems, coupled through constraints and objectives. The proposed method substitutes affected coupling constraints in such a way that the scheme can not become infeasible, while a decrease in the cost is guaranteed.},

@book{Borrelli2017,
abstract = {The major contribution of this book is to show how the nonlinear optimal feed- back controller can be calculated efficiently for some important classes of systems, namely linear systems with constraints and switched linear systems or, more gen- erally, hybrid systems. Traditionally, the design of feedback controllers for linear systems with constraints, for example anti-windup techniques, was ad hoc requiring both much experience and trial and error. Though significant progress has been achieved on anti-windup schemes over the last decade, these techniques deal with input constraints only and cannot be extended easily.},

@article{Liberzon1999,
abstract = {By a switched system, we mean a hybrid dynamical system consisting of afamily of continuous-time subsystems and a rule that orchestrates the switching between them. This article surveys recent developments in three basic problems regarding stability and design of switched systems. These problems are: stability for arbitrary switching sequcnces, stability for certain useful classes of switching sequences, and construction of stabilizing switching sequences. We also provide motivation for studying these problems by discussing how they arise in connection with various questions of interest in control theory and applications.},

@inproceedings{Morse1999,
abstract = {It is shown that switching among stable linear systems results in a stable system provided that switching is “slow-on-the-average.” In particular, it is proved that exponential stability is achieved when the number of switches in any finite interval grows linearly with the length of the interval, and the growth rate is suffi- ciently small. Moreover, the exponential stability is uniform over all switchings with the above property. For switched systems with inputs this guarantees that several input-to-state induced norms are bounded uni- formly over all slow-on-the-average switchings. These results extend to classes of nonlinear switched systems that satisfy suitable uniformity assumptions. In this paper it is also shown that, in a supervisory control con- text, scale-independent hysteresis can produce switch- ing that is slow-on-the-average and therefore the results mentioned above can be used to study the stability of hysteresis-based adaptive control systems.},
