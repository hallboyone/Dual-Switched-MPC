 \section{Literature Review}
 \subsection{Key contributions of this paper}
 This paper examines systems that
 \begin{enumerate}
 	\item are distributed,
 	\item are coupled through states,
 	\item are uncoupled through constraints,
 	\item have locally switching dynamics,
 	\item have a switching network according to local switches,
 	\item have local, constrained, external switching signals.
 \end{enumerate}
 How does this compare with other papers?

\cite{Ahandani2020} examines decentralized systems under MPC with switching communication topologies and dynamics coupling. The switching is generated from a centralized signal with a minimum dwell time constraint. The local agents are assumed LTI while the cross dynamics change according to the switching signal. This leads to an external disturbance drawn from a switching set applied to each node. This is rejected using tube-based, switched MPC. 

\cite{Monasterios2019} examines systems under MPC that are provided a preview of future disturbances. The preview evolves through disturbed shifting dynamics. The primary results of the paper show that, if the change in disturbance is ``small enough'', the system can maintain feasibility and stability with augmented terminal control elements. It does not, however, consider switching either locally nor remotely.
