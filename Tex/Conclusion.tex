\section{Conclusion}
In the previous literature ensuring persistent feasibility in externally switched systems, the curse of dimensionality has prevented the study of large scale systems. Furthermore, this computational inefficiency has limited these previous methods' application to systems with multiple switching signals. This work addresses both of these difficulties in systems representing distributed systems coupled through their states. A graph based constraint scheme was described to constrain each agent's switching signal that provides much greater flexibility than previous dwell time constraints. Iterative algorithms where then developed that efficiently computed time-varying state constraints that, when respected, ensure feasibility under all permutations of the switching signals. 

Though this work provides techniques of ensuring feasibility, it makes limited use of results from distributed system literature such as \cite{Monasterios2019}. Currently, only the current state of neighboring agents is used. In future work, a unified framework will be developed that uses the multi-step state prediction provided by receding horizon controllers. This will loosen the bounds on feasibility and reduce the control cost. Further, future work should examine advancements allowing for plug-and-play features that would allow agents to be dynamically added and removed from the system.
