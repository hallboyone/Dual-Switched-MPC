The results of this work are demonstrated in an array of independently controlled agents coupled with springs and dampers as shown in \autoref{fig:num_ex_sys}. The objects move in the dimension denoted by $x_{i,j}$. The mass of each agent can switch between one of three values according to the directed graph shown in \autoref{fig:num_ex_graph}. The linearized dynamics of the top left system is given here as an illustration 
\begin{align*}
m_{11}(\ss_{11}(t))\ddot{x}_{11}(t) = &k_{11|12}(x_{12}(t)-x_{11}(t))\\
+&k_{11|21}(x_{21}(t)-x_{11}(t))\\
+&b_{11|12}(\dot x_{21}(t)-\dot x_{11}(t))\\
+&b_{11|21}(\dot x_{21}(t)-\dot x_{11}(t)) + u_{11}(t)
\end{align*}
 where the spring and dampener coefficients have been scaled to account for the angle at which they apply their force. These dynamics where discretized for each agent at a sampling time of $0.3$ seconds. For a system comprised of an $r\times c$ array of linked spring-mass-damper systems, the full state space will be in $\real^{2rc}$. Even for small, $2\times 2$ systems, the resulting 8D system is too large for previous set based methods on a conventional PC. However, using the results of this work to parallelize the algorithm, only set operations in $\real^2$ are required. Assuming each agent has it's own independent processing, the computational complexity will grow at a sub-exponential rate with the number of agents. Running \autoref{alg:safe_sets} on the spring-mass-damper grid with randomized masses and spring/damper coefficients resulted in the safe-set evolution shown in \autoref{fig:num_ex_results} for mode 1 of node 1. The numerical example implementation has been archived for the interested reader \cite{PaperSoftware}.
