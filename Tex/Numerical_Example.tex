The results of this work are demonstrated in an array of independently controlled agents coupled with with springs and dampers as shown in \autoref{fig:num_ex_sys}. The objects move in the dimension denoted by $x_{i,j}$. The mass of each agent can switch between one of three values according to the directed graph shown in \autoref{fig:num_ex_graph}. For a system comprised of an $r\times c$ array of linked spring-mass-damper systems, the full state space will be in $\real^2rc$. Even for small, $2\times 2$ systems, the resulting 8D system is too large for previous set based methods. However, using the results of this work to parallelize the algorithm, only set operations in $\real^2$ are required. Assuming each agent has it's own independent processing, the computational complexity will grow at a sub-exponential rate with the number of agents. Running \autoref{alg:safe_sets} on the spring-mass-damper grid with randomized masses and spring/damper coefficients resulted in the safe-set evolution show in \autoref{fig:num_ex_results} for mode 1 of node 1. The numerical example implementation has been archived for future reference \alert{cite}.
