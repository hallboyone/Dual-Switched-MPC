Ensuring feasibility in externally switched systems usually requires identifying time-varying, control invariant (CI) sets that ensure state and input constraints can be respected under any possible switching signal. As with traditional, time-invariant (CI) sets, these time-varying constraints can be very difficult to compute for higher dimensional system. Furthermore, if multiple switching signals are present, the number of possible realizations of the signal states grows exponentially. Previous works would struggle to account for this growth. In this work, a class of distributed systems that are both high dimension and with multiple switching signals is examined. The switching signals are constrained using directed graphs that are much more flexible than dwell time based methods used in much of the previous literature. An iterative algorithm is developed that computes the time-varying CI sets for this class of systems. Critically, this algorithm parallelizes over the number of agents. This prevents the exponential growth in computation time as agents are added to the system. These results are demonstrated on a randomized numerical example.
